Specifications:
*This file should only be edited by humans*

- Review and deeply understand the codebase. Summarize your findings and figure out the idea behind the frontend and what needs to be done with our backend together with the database.
- Create a dot_env.example that specifices the adresses of the frontend, backend and database.
- Keep the frontend as it is, only change the backend with this prompt.
- I REPEAT: *Keep the frontend as it is, only change the backend with this prompt.*
- Connect a PostgreSQL Database using a configurable port. 
- Everything goes into separate docker containers.
- Use JWT / Database tokens for Authentication.
- Use the new version of compose, i.e. compose.yml, NOT docker-compose.yml
- Setup models.py using SQL Alchemy 2.0 for mapping the database.
- Open Up Access Rights for any databases. Use a simple static password for PostgreSQL.
- Create a FastAPI Backend (hosted on a configurable port) that communicates with the frontend using endpoints that are relevant in this context.
- Be very careful and don't make the Pydantic structures overly complex.

Let's make this in very small steps. Let's work like this:

- You implement exactly what we agreed (and no more!) for the step in question
- Always remember instructions.txt for additional instructions.
- See instructions.txt and keep it as context throughout the entire process.
- Do not refactor any code (or change any existing functionality) without asking and warning me specifically.
- You verify VERY carefully that the program works, both regression-wise and the newly implemented features/changes.

Any questions?
If not, go but keep it step by step.
Make me proud!
